I am currently a researcher at **Huawei**, where I focus on the full lifecycle of Large Language Models, spanning from **LLM Training** to **Inference Acceleration**. My core expertise lies in optimizing high-performance AI systems, with a particular emphasis on large-scale **Model Pre-training/Fine-tuning**, **Speculative Decoding**, and efficient **Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)** infrastructure. I have extensive experience in training Large Language Models from scratch and optimizing their downstream performance.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. from **Soochow University**, where I was privileged to be advised by Prof. [Min Zhang](https://zhangmin-nlp-ai.github.io/) and Prof. [Zhenghua Li](https://web.suda.edu.cn/zhli13/). My academic background is rooted in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, where I conducted extensive research on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and syntactic parsing. This unique blend of deep linguistic understanding, model training expertise, and large-scale system optimization allows me to tackle the most challenging problems in modern LLM development and deployment.
